CCNY ACM Website
================

[Official Website](http://ccnyacm.github.io/) of City College of New York's ACM Club.

This is still a work in progress and as such this website is not entirely usable on all browsers and devices. Our next goal is to fully support mobile web on commonly used mobile browsers such as Chrome and Safari.

###Support:
####Desktop Browsers
This website is currently supported (for sure) on Safari 9.0 and Google Chrome 46. Currently there are a few bugs :mask: that will need to be addressed on the Firefox 40 and 41. Sorry IE folks... not yet.

####Mobile Browsers
There is partial support for Google Chrome 45. We currently have non-responsive navbar that needs to be changed! :panda_face:

###Technologies:
This was built using [Pure](https://github.com/yahoo/pure/) <3, [bxSlider](http://bxslider.com), [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com), and [Jorge Yao](https://github.com/codenameyau)'s awesome [flip.js](https://github.com/codenameyau/flip.js).
